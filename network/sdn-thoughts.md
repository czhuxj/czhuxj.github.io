# SDN Thoughts

Just as containers are innovations in connection costs, not in connection methods, SDN is an innovation in network connection costs because it still uses various network elements such as optical fibers, routers, and communication protocols.

Standardization is the key to reducing the cost of network connectivity. The original idea of SDN is to separate software and hardware, and then standardize software and standardized hardware based on the OpenFlow protocol. The standardization here mainly refers to the standardization of manufacturing (for example, Huawei's software runs on Cisco's routers), rather than the standardization of intercommunication protocols (TCP/IP).

The current situation of SDN is that the development of standardized software and hardware supporting OpenFlow is slow.

Another concept of SDN is centralized control. Centralized control itself cannot increase network bandwidth or reduce network latency out of thin air. The value of centralized control lies in the fact that under the premise of link resources with high bandwidth and low delay, it can improve bandwidth utilization through effective scheduling, and reasonably deploy services with different delay requirements to run on corresponding links.
